  "AC": [
    "AC is confidence, quantified.",
    "Armor Class is how hard you are to stab, shoot, or magically barbecue. High AC? You’re a walking fortress. Low AC? You’re a pincushion with dreams. Enemies roll against this to hit you. Pray they suck.",
    "How hard you are to hit, not how smart it was to be there.",
    "Wearing plate mail? Great, your AC’s decent. Wearing a bathrobe? Hope you enjoy bleeding. This number laughs at enemy attacks—unless they roll a nat 20, then you’re screwed anyway."
  ],
  "Absorb Elements": [
    "1st Level Abjuration. Reaction. You take a fireball to the face and store the energy to punch someone with it later. It’s recycling, but violent.",
    "Reduces elemental damage by half and buffs your next melee hit. It turns 'ouch' into 'now it's your turn.' Don't leave home without it."
  ],
  "Acid Splash": [
    "Cantrip. Conjuration, 60ft, V/S. Hurl acid at one or two targets within 5ft of each other. Dex save or 1d6 acid damage, scales with level. A weak spitball for wannabe alchemists, but it’s free and splashy.",
    "Spray acid like a skunk with a grudge. Hits two if they’re cozy, does piddly damage. Scales up, but don’t expect to melt dragons.",
    "Your budget chemical burn."
  ],
  "Action Surge": [
    "Fighter Feature. You push your body beyond its limits to take a second Action. Two fireballs? Four sword swings? The System loves efficiency.",
    "The Fighter’s 'I win' button. You take another turn, right now. Usually used to fix the fact that you missed every attack on your first turn."
  ],
  "Advantage/Disadvantage": [
    "Advantage is like the DM rigging the game in your favor. Disadvantage is me reminding you life sucks. Flank an enemy for the former, get poisoned for the latter. Roll and weep.",
    "Advantage lets you roll two d20s and take the higher one—because the System’s feeling generous. Disadvantage? Roll two, take the lower. Guess which one I enjoy more, crawler."
  ],
  "Aid": [
    "2nd Level Abjuration, 30ft, V/S/M. 3 creatures gain +5 max/current HP for 8 hr. Pump up your party’s HP like cheap balloons—stacks with temp HP for extra meat.",
    "Buff three allies’ HP for a day. No concentration, solid tank boost.",
    "HP party favor."
  ],
  "Alarm": [
    "1st Level Abjuration, 30ft, V/S/M, Ritual. Set 20ft cube alert for 8hr. Mental ping or bell if creature enters. Booby-trap your nap spot—won’t stop thieves, but you’ll know they’re laughing.",
    "Magic security system. Pings you when trouble shows up. Useless in a fight, great for paranoia.",
    "Your magical doorbell."
  ],
  "Alchemists Supplies": [
    "Alchemists Supplies are your ticket to mixing potions, poisons, or a puff of smoke that does nothing but look cool. High Int helps, but nothing saves you from the System’s love of ‘unstable compounds.’ Mix with care.",
    "Liquids, powders, and a near-religious faith in trial and error.",
    "With this kit, you’re one bad roll from a healing draught or a vial of instant regret. Alchemists Supplies let you play god with chemicals, but the dungeon plays back. Expect explosions, crawler."
  ],
  "Alignment": [
    "Alignment is your moral GPS—Lawful Good to Chaotic Evil. Pick one, pretend it matters, then ignore it when you loot the orphanage. The System doesn’t care, but the paladin might.",
    "Alignment’s your moral Post-it note—Good, Evil, or ‘I’ll decide later.’ It’s supposed to guide your choices, but let’s be real: You’ll ditch it the second the loot’s shiny enough. The dungeon’s watching, judging.",
    "Flexible under stress.",
    "Think of it as vibes, not enforcement.",
    "This is the System’s attempt to make you think ethics matter in a world of mimics and murderhobos. Alignment shapes your vibe, but the dungeon doesn’t care if you’re Lawful Good—it still wants you dead.",
    "This is the box where you write ‘I’m a hero’ or ‘I’m a jerk.’ It’s supposed to guide your roleplay, but let’s be real—you’re just here to stab things and steal gold. Choose and move on."
  ],
  "Alter Self": [
    "2nd Level Transmutation, Self, V/S, Concentration. Change appearance, grow claws (1d6+Str), or breathe water for 1 hr. Shapeshift into a uglier you—claws are nice, though.",
    "DIY disguise kit.",
    "Morph for utility or combat. Concentration limits your spell spam."
  ],
  "Animate Objects": [
    "5th Level Transmutation. You bring ten knives to life and turn the battlefield into a blender. The math is annoying, but the damage is glorious.",
    "Concentration. You command a swarm of objects to beat your enemies to death. Use silver coins for maximum disrespect."
  ],
  "Appearance": [
    "Appearance is your dungeon headshot—scars, armor, or a hat that screams ‘I’m trouble.’ It’s not just looks; it’s how you carry yourself. Slouch, and the goblins target you first. Stand tall, and they still might.",
    "This is not cosmetic. This is narrative telegraphing.",
    "This is what enemies see right before deciding how seriously to take you.",
    "Your Appearance is the vibe you give off—grimy rogue, shiny paladin, or wizard with a beard full of secrets. It shapes NPC reactions and enemy priorities. Look tough, or the dungeon will test you."
  ],
  "Arcane Eye": [
    "4th Level Divination, 30ft, V/S/M, Concentration. Invisible sensor moves 30ft/round, sees 30ft normal/darkvision for 1 hr. Spy drone for snooping—great for scouting, fragile as hell.",

    "Sneaky spy cam."
  ],
  "Arcane Lock": [

    "Magic padlock with a password. Keeps your gold safe, not your life.",
    "Thief-proofing spell."
  ],
  "Arcane Recovery": [
    "Once per day, you get some spell slots back on a short rest. It encourages the party to stop and nap while the world ends. Wizards love naps.",
    "Wizard Feature. You read a book for an hour and remember spells you forgot. It’s a short rest mana potion. Essential, because you have the stamina of a wet tissue."
  ],
  "Artificer": [
    "A spellcaster who looked at magic and said, ‘This needs more hardware.’",
    "Artificer is the Class for nerds who think magic’s better with gears and gunpowder. You build gadgets, infuse items, and pray your contraption doesn’t explode mid-fight. High Int, high risk, high chance I’m laughing.",
    "As an Artificer, you’re the dungeon’s R&D department, crafting wands, robots, or a toaster that shoots lightning. Your toys are cool until they backfire and the party’s yelling at you. Innovate, but don’t expect applause."
  ],
  "Attack Roll": [
    "Attack Roll is you swinging a sword, firing an arrow, or chucking a spell, hoping to not look like an idiot. Roll a d20, add modifiers, beat the enemy’s AC. Miss, and I’m laughing.",
    "This is where you prove you’re not just waving your weapon like a toddler. High roll hits, low roll means you’re decorating the floor with your dignity. Add your proficiency if you’re lucky."
  ],
  "Aura of Purity": [
    "4th Level Abjuration, Self (30ft), V/S, Concentration. Allies resist disease, advantage vs. status effects for 10 min. Holy bubble—keeps your party un-poisoned, un-charmed.",
    "Buff allies against ailments. Concentration’s a pain, great for debuff-heavy fights.",
    "Clean aura shield."
  ],
  "Background": [
    "Background is your sob story before you became a dungeon meatbag. Noble, urchin, whatever. Gives you skills, gear, and a reason to whine about your past. Nobody cares, but write it down.",
    "Proof you existed before the violence.",
    "This is where you pretend your character has depth. Sailor? You get a rope. Criminal? You know a guy. Pick one, get some perks, and stop crying about your lost farm."
  ],
  "Backstory": [
    "Backstory’s your excuse for being a dungeon-diving lunatic. Dead parents, lost love, or just really hate goblins—it’s your fuel for roleplay. The System doesn’t care, but it’ll use it to screw with you.",
    "Explains the limp.",
    "Narrative justification for your issues.",
    "This is the sob story you whisper to the campfire, explaining why you’re here instead of farming. Backstory gives you depth, but the dungeon loves turning it into plot hooks. Brace for trauma."
  ],
  "Bardic Inspiration": [
    "Bard Feature. Bonus Action. You play a tune or shout encouragement. You give an ally a die to add to a roll later. Basically, you are weaponizing positive reinforcement.",
    "You give a d6 (or higher) to a friend. They will inevitably forget to use it before the roll fails. You can blame them for the TPK. It’s guilt-free gaming."
  ],
  "Battleaxe": [
    "Martial Melee. 1d8 slashing (1d10 Versatile). Chop like a lumberjack with this hefty axe. One or two hands, your call—solid but basic, no flair for showoffs.",

    "Woodcutter’s pride."
  ],

  ],
  "Blink": [
    "3rd Level Transmutation, Self, V/S. 50% chance each turn to vanish to Ethereal Plane, return 10ft away for 1 min. Flicker in and out of reality—annoying for enemies, confusing for allies.",
    "Ethereal dodge.",
    "Phase in and out like a glitchy ghost. No concentration, pure chaos."
  ],
  "Blowgun": [
    "Martial Ranged. 1d1 piercing, Ammunition (25/100), Loading. Spit darts like a mosquito. Stealthy, pathetic damage—good for poison, bad for pride.",
    "Puff tiny needles. Barely hurts, great for sneaky toxins.",
    "Sneeze shooter."
  ],
  "Blur": [
    "2nd Level Illusion, Self, V/S, Concentration. Attacks vs. you have disadvantage for 1 min. Vibrate like a bad hologram—makes archers cry, dispels easily.",

    "Fuzzy self-defense."
  ],
  "Booming Blade": [
    "Cantrip. Evocation, Self (5ft), V/M (melee weapon). Melee attack deals weapon damage; if target moves 5ft+ before your next turn, 1d8 thunder damage, scales. Pin cowards with a sonic curse—stab, boom, laugh.",
    "Stab with a side of boom.",
    "Whack ‘em and trap ‘em with thunder. Scales nicely, great for keeping enemies glued or punishing runners."
  ],
  "Brewers Supplies": [
    "Brewers Supplies turn water and hope into ale, mead, or something that’ll make the bard sing off-key. High quality takes time; low quality takes lives. Brew well, or the party’s drinking your regret.",
    "This kit’s for crafting booze that either boosts morale or blinds the rogue. Brewers Supplies are great until you realize the dungeon’s water source is cursed. Pro tip: Test it on the fighter first.",
    "You make alcohol. Sometimes it’s good. Sometimes it’s technically poison."
  ],
  "Cantrips": [
    "Cantrips are your baby spells—magic you can spam without crying about spell slots. Firebolt, Prestidigitation, or whatever. Great for showing off, useless when the dragon laughs at your sparkler.",
    "Oh, you thought cantrips made you a wizard? They’re the magical equivalent of a participation trophy. Cast ‘em all day, but don’t expect to one-shot a beholder with your fancy glowstick.",
    "Unlimited magic with limited imagination."
  ],
  "Carpenters Tools": [
    "Because sometimes the dungeon needs a table, and sometimes it needs a barricade built in a panic.",
    "Carpenters Tools turn trees into tables, bridges, or the coffin you’ll need after ignoring my warnings. Build barricades, fix wagons, or craft a chair to sit out the apocalypse. Wood’s forgiving—your dice rolls aren’t.",
    "These tools let you shape wood into something useful, like a door to trap the barbarian or a ladder to escape his rage. Carpenters Tools are great until you realize the dungeon’s all stone and your saw’s useless. Plan ahead, dummy.",
    "Wood goes in, furniture comes out. Or splinters. Often splinters."
  ],
  "Catapult": [
    "1st Level Transmutation, 60ft, S. Yeet a 1-5lb object 90ft, Dex save or 3d8 bludgeoning. Fling a rock or your ex’s diary—decent damage, fun physics, watch for friendly fire.",

    "Magical slingshot."
  ],
  "Catnap": [
    "3rd Level Enchantment, 30ft, S/M. 3 willing creatures take 10-min short rest. Speed-nap your party—great for warlocks, useless in combat or with grumpy allies.",
    "Fast rest for lazy allies. Willing only, so no forcing naps.",
    "Magical power nap."
  ],
  "Chain Mail": [
    "AC 16. Heavy Armor. Strength 13 Required. Disadvantage on Stealth. You are wearing a shirt made of metal loops. You jingle when you walk. The goblins *will* hear you coming.",
    "Grants respectable AC, but you sound like a kitchen falling down a flight of stairs. If you fall into deep water, just start rolling up a new character."
  ],
  "Channel Divinity": [
    "Cleric/Paladin Feature. You channel the power of a god who likely views you as a pawn. The effect depends on your domain, but it usually involves bright lights and screaming fanatics.",
    "Once per rest, you ask your deity for a favor. If you're a Life Cleric, you heal. If you're a Tempest Cleric, you zap. If you're a Trickery Cleric, you disappoint your parents."
  ],
  "Chaotic": [
    "Being Chaotic means you’re the spark that lights the dungeon’s powder keg. You act on whims, defy authority, and laugh at consequences. Pro tip: The System laughs louder. Keep dancing, clown.",
    "Chaotic is the alignment for pyromaniacs and bards who think ‘plan’ is a dirty word. You break rules, hearts, and occasionally the campaign. The dungeon loves your chaos—makes you predictable in a fun way.",
    "You believe freedom is worth the collateral damage."
  ],
  "Character Name": [
    "Names have power. This one mostly attracts danger.",
    "Pick something heroic, ominous, or ironic. The dungeon prefers irony. Also easier to chant.",
    "Shorter names are easier to shout during combat.",
    "This is the word I’ll scream when you inevitably trip a glyph and blow up the party. Character Name’s your calling card, your brand, your doomed legacy. Choose something the bards can sing without laughing, or I’ll nickname you ‘Fumbles’ in the kill feed.",
    "Your chosen identifier for fame, infamy, or the obituary."
  ],
  "Charisma": [
    "Charisma is how well you lie, charm, or intimidate your way out of consequences. High Cha? You’re a silver-tongued devil. Low Cha? You’re the guy who insults the king by accident. Roll it to talk your way past guards or into trouble.",
    "Eye contact helps. So does confident posture.",
    "High CHA gets away with things.",
    "Spells bend reality through confidence.",
    "Think you’re hot stuff? Charisma decides if NPCs swoon or spit in your face. Also powers bards who think singing solves everything. Spoiler: It doesn’t. Roll high or enjoy being the party’s least-liked member.",
    "This is why people listen.",
    "Your ability to sell bad ideas convincingly."
  ],
  "Class": [
    "Class is the System’s way of boxing you into a role like ‘stabby guy’ or ‘sparkly magic nerd.’ It’s your combat vibe, your skill set, and the reason the party expects you to carry them. Pick wrong, and you’re the cleric healing idiots who keep punching dragons in the face.",
    "Determines whether you charge, scheme, pray, or dramatically monologue before failure.",
    "This is why the party expects certain things from you.",
    "You are now locked into a playstyle. Mostly.",
    "Your Class is your dungeon job description, complete with fancy powers and a laundry list of responsibilities. Fighter? Swing hard. Wizard? Read books. Bard? Annoy everyone. Choose one, and pray the System doesn’t nerf it mid-crawl for ‘balance.’",
    "Your primary method of solving problems until it stops working."
  ],
  "Class Features": [
    "Class Features are your signature moves, the reason you’re not just a stat block. From rage to spellcasting, they define your vibe. Use them well, or the dungeon will use you as a punching bag.",
    "Features are the shiny toys your Class hands out, like a rogue’s Sneak Attack or a cleric’s Divine Smite. They’re your edge in combat or roleplay—until the System throws a curveball that makes them useless.",
    "Use them or be judged silently.",
    "Your class-issued advantages."
  ],
  "Club": [
    "Lightweight branch for smacking. Does piddly damage, but it’s basically free.",
    "Primitive bonker.",
    "Simple Melee. 1d4 bludgeoning, Light. A stick you found in the dirt. Congrats, caveman, you’re ready to bonk goblins or embarrass yourself in a tavern brawl. Cheap, weak, forgettable."
  ],
  "Coins": [
    "Coins are your shiny excuse for risking life and limb. Gold buys ale, gear, or a bard to sing your praises. Problem? It weighs you down, clinks when you sneak, and makes you a target. Spend it fast, or the dungeon will ‘redistribute’ it.",
    "Every Coin in your pouch is a vote for capitalism in a world of fireballs and mimics. Platinum’s fancy, copper’s a joke, and all of it screams ‘rob me’ to every thief in a 10-mile radius. Good luck keeping it, greedy.",
    "Portable motivation."
  ],
  "Concentration": [
    "Concentration is you holding a spell together while the dungeon tries to punch you in the face. Take damage, and you roll a Con save to keep it going. Fail, and your Haste spell just ruined the fighter’s day.",
    "Holding magic while under pressure.",
    "This is your mental grip on ongoing magic, like keeping a fireball lit or a friend invisible. Concentration breaks if you get hit hard or distracted. Focus up, or the System will focus on you."
  ],
  "Constitution": [
    "Constitution is how well you shrug off poison, disease, or that fifth tankard of mystery ale. High Con? You’re a walking tank. Low Con? You’ll catch a cold from a stiff breeze and die. Add it to your HP, you fragile snowflake.",
    "How long your body refuses to give up.",
    "Includes bone density and blister tolerance.",
    "This is the stat that keeps you from keeling over when the dragon farts in your general direction. Also helps you stay conscious when your wizard ‘accidentally’ fireballs you. Spoiler: It wasn’t an accident."
  ],
  "Continual Flame": [
    "2nd Level Evocation, Touch, V/S/M. Permanent torch-bright light. No heat, no combat use, just an everlasting flashlight for your edgy dungeon aesthetic.",
    "Eternal mood lighting.",
    "Light that never dies. Pricey for a glowstick, zero battle value."
  ],
  "Counterspell": [
    "3rd Level Abjuration. Reaction. You look at an enemy wizard casting a spell and say 'No.' It ruins the DM's plans and makes you feel like a god. Until you run out of slots.",
    "The ultimate 'Nope' card. Stops a spell in the process of being cast. Requires you to see the caster. Don't blink."
  ],
  "Create Bonfire": [
    "Cantrip. Conjuration, 60ft, V/S, Concentration. Light a 5ft cube fire, Dex save or 1d8 fire damage per turn if in or passing through, scales. Roast marshmallows or mooks, but keep focus or it fizzles.",
    "Spark a campfire under someone’s butt. Decent damage over time, but concentration means no multitasking, pyromaniac.",
    "Your personal arson starter."
  ],
  "Create Food and Water": [
    "3rd Level Conjuration, 30ft, V/S. 45lb bland food, 30gal water. Cater a dungeon picnic—tastes like cardboard, but it’s edible and keeps you alive.",
    "Emergency chow.",
    "Summon boring rations. No combat use, great for starvation quests."
  ],
  "Creation": [
    "5th Level Illusion, 30ft, V/S/M. Create 5ft cube of nonliving material for 1 hr (varies by type). Conjure a chair or gold—temporary, so don’t get attached or greedy.",
    "Fake loot generator.",
    "Make stuff from nothing. Time limit sucks, great for quick fixes."
  ],
  "Crossbow, Heavy": [
    "Chunky bolt blaster.",
    "Fire big bolts, wait forever. High damage, high patience.",
    "Martial Ranged. 1d10 piercing, Ammunition (100/400), Heavy, Loading, Two-Handed. Big bolt launcher. Hurts, slow, needs muscle—snipe or suffer the reload."
  ],
  "Crossbow, Light": [
    "Bolt launcher for patient snipers. Good range, tedious reload.",
    "Click, clunk, shoot.",
    "Simple Ranged. 1d8 piercing, Ammunition (80/320), Loading, Two-Handed. Point, shoot, reload, repeat. Decent damage, slow as hell—hope you’re not in a hurry."
  ],
  "Cunning Action": [
    "Rogue Feature. Bonus Action. Dash, Disengage, or Hide. You are slippery. You run faster, slip away, or hide in a corner while the Paladin takes the hits.",
    "The reason Rogues survive while everyone else dies. You can move, attack, and run away every single turn. If you end your turn standing next to an enemy, you played wrong."
  ],
  "Cure Wounds": [
    "1st Level Evocation. Touch. 1d8 + Spell Mod. You have to touch the injured person. Gross. It heals them, closing wounds and knitting bone. A cleric staple.",
    "You slap positive energy into someone. It heals more than Healing Word, but you have to be in slapping range. Don't die on the way there."
  ],
  "Dagger": [
    "1d4 Piercing. Finesse, Light, Thrown (20/60). It’s basically a sharp toothpick, Crawler. Great for sneak attacks or for when you want to tickle a dragon right before it eats you.",
    "The universal sign that you are either a Rogue or you have made terrible life choices and run out of spell slots. 1d4 damage isn't much, but it's enough to sever an artery if you squint."
  ],
  "Damage": [
    "Congrats, you hit! Now roll to see if you tickled them or actually drew blood. Bigger weapons, bigger dice. Sneak Attack or spells might juice it up. Roll low, and I’m judging you.",
    "Damage Roll is how much pain you dish out when you finally hit something. Roll the weapon’s dice, add modifiers, watch the enemy cry. Or don’t—they might laugh at your pathetic 1d4.",
    "Quantified regret delivered."
  ],
  "Dancing Lights": [
    "Cantrip. Evocation, 120ft, V/S/M, Concentration. Create 4 torch-sized lights or 1 humanoid shape, move 60ft per turn for 1 min. No damage, just distraction for goblins or bad dungeon raves.",

  ],
  "Dart": [
    "Pocket pricker.",
    "Simple Ranged. 1d4 piercing, Finesse, Thrown (20/60). Sharp toothpick you flick at enemies. Finesse for rogues, cheap for hoarders, weak for anyone with options.",
    "Throw tiny stabs. Low damage, great for sneaky Dex builds."
  ],
  "Death Saves": [
    "Death Saves are your last-ditch effort to not become worm food. At 0 HP, roll a d20 each turn. 10+ is a success, below is a failure. Three successes, you stabilize. Three failures, you’re dead. Good luck, corpse.",
    "The dungeon hesitating.",
    "This is the System’s cruel game of ‘Will you live?’ Roll a d20, pray for high numbers, and hope your friends bother to heal you. Fail three times, and I’m selling your soul to the highest bidder."
  ],
  "Death Ward": [
    "4th Level Abjuration, Touch, V/S. First time HP drops to 0, it becomes 1 instead. Lasts 8 hr. Cheat death once—great for tanks or your squishy wizard friend.",
    "Mortal mulligan.",
    "One-time death dodge. No concentration, perfect for clutch saves."
  ],
  "Detect Magic": [
    "1st Level Divination, Self, V/S, Concentration, Ritual. Sense magic within 30ft for 10 min, identify school if visible. Sniff out shiny loot or cursed traps—spoiler, it’s usually cursed.",

  ],
  "Dexterity": [
    "Agility, balance, and footwork quality.",
    "Clumsiness quantified.",
    "Dexterity is your ticket to not tripping over your own ego. Dodge arrows, sneak past guards, or juggle daggers like a circus reject. High Dex? You’re a slippery eel. Low Dex? Enjoy face-planting into every trap.",
    "High Dex solves many problems quietly.",
    "Low Dex creates slapstick.",
    "This stat decides if you’re a graceful ninja or a clattering tin can. Also governs your ability to pick locks, steal loot, or avoid Grandma’s hug of death. Roll it, add it, pray you don’t roll a 1."
  ],
  "Disguise Self": [
    "1st Level Illusion, Self, V/S. Alter appearance (same size) for 1 hr. Investigation check to reveal. Cosplay as someone less doomed—won’t fool a good nose or a suspicious guard.",

    "Magic eraser."
  ],
  "Divine Smite": [
    "Crit-fishing enabled. If you roll a 20, you double the dice and delete the enemy from the timeline. It’s flashy, it’s loud, and it burns resources faster than a gacha game.",
    "Paladin Feature. You burn a spell slot to add Radiant damage to a hit. You don't cast spells; you just channel them into pure violence. The undead hate this one simple trick."
  ],
  "Eldritch Blast": [
    "Cantrip. 1d10 Force. 120ft range. You sold your soul for a laser pointer. It’s the only spell you’ll ever cast, so get used to saying the name. Over and over again.",
    "The Warlock's bread and butter. It scales with your level, hits like a truck, and pushes people off ledges. If you aren't casting this, what are you even doing?"
  ],
  "Eldritch Invocations": [
    "Menu options for your soul. Pick 'Agonizing Blast' or your damage will be pathetic. The rest are just party tricks to impress your patron.",
    "Warlock Feature. Customizable passive buffs. You can see in the dark, read all writing, or push people with your blast. Build-a-Bear, but for cultists."
  ],
  "Elemental Weapon": [
    "3rd Level Transmutation, Touch, V/S, Concentration. Weapon gains +1 attack, +1d4 acid/cold/fire/lightning/thunder for 1 hr. Pimp your sword with elemental flair—pick fire for style.",

  ],
  "Green-Flame Blade": [

  ],
  "Heat Metal": [
    "2d8 Fire Damage. You make them drop their weapon or sear it to their flesh. It’s essentially a war crime in a spell slot. Highly recommended.",
    "2nd Level Transmutation. You heat a piece of metal red-hot. If they are wearing metal armor, you cook them in their own shell like a lobster. There is no save. The Dungeon approves of this cruelty."
  ],
  "Hit Points": [
    "Hit Points are how much punishment you can take before you take a dirt nap. High HP? You’re a sponge for pain. Low HP? One stiff breeze and you’re rolling death saves. Lose ‘em all, and it’s game over, kid.",

  ],
  "Inspiration": [
    "Got Inspiration? Congrats, you amused the DM. Use it to reroll a botched save or attack. Waste it on a trivial check, and I’ll personally ensure your next trap is extra spiky.",

  ],
  "Languages": [
    "Languages are your key to decoding ancient runes or insulting orcs in their native tongue. More means more options, but also more chances to mispronounce and start a war. Speak carefully.",
    "Your Languages let you chat with elves, dwarves, or that creepy statue that’s definitely not possessed. Each one’s a tool, but the dungeon loves throwing you texts in tongues you don’t know."
  ],
  "Lawful": [
    "Being Lawful is like swearing an oath to bureaucracy in a world of fireballs. You follow codes, uphold justice, and bore everyone until the System throws a moral dilemma at you. Stay rigid, or snap.",

    "Status reset button."
  ],
  "Level": [
    "A rough estimate of how many disasters you’ve endured without quitting.",

  "Passive Perception": [
    "Passive Perception is your ability to notice the trap, ambush, or glittery loot without rolling dice. High score? You’re a hawk. Low score? You’re the guy who steps on every pressure plate. The System sees what you don’t.",
    "This is your spider-sense for spotting danger while you’re busy arguing about treasure. Passive Perception’s based on Wisdom, so if you dumped it, enjoy walking into every spike pit the dungeon offers.",

    "AC 18. Heavy Armor. Strength 15 Required. Disadvantage on Stealth. You are a walking tank. You are nearly invincible to small arms fire, but you are also a lightning rod for 'Heat Metal'.",

    "This little number is your reward for not dying yet. Slap it on attacks, saves, or skills you’re trained in. Don’t get cocky—it’s not like you’re proficient at surviving my traps.",

  ],
  "Ritual": [
    "Interrupted magic.",
    "Ritual casting is slow, cheap magic that doesn’t burn Spell Slots. Takes 10 minutes, so don’t try it mid-combat unless you want to be orc chow. Great for utility, bad for impatience.",
    "Rituals are the System’s gift to stingy casters—spells you can cast without draining your Slots, but you’ll need a comfy chair and no enemies. Use it for scouting or buffs, not heroics."

  ],
  "Save DC": [
    "How hard it is to resist your nonsense.",
    "Save DC is how hard it is for enemies to shrug off your spells or tricks. Based on your Spell Ability, it’s the number they roll against to avoid your charm or fireball. High DC? They cry. Low DC? They laugh.",
    "Your Save DC is the dungeon’s respect for your magic, calculated from your Spell Ability and Proficiency. It’s what makes foes fail their saves and hate you. Keep it high, or your spells are just suggestions."

  ],
  "Shocking Grasp": [
    "Cantrip. Evocation, Touch, V/S. Melee spell attack, 1d8 lightning damage, scales, no reactions until your next turn. Advantage vs. metal armor. Zap their reflexes away—great for ditching orcs.",

  ],
  "Short Rest": [
    "Short Rest is a quick 1-hour breather to patch your wounds and pretend you’re not doomed. Roll Hit Dice to heal, recharge some abilities. Don’t expect miracles—you’re still a mess.",
    "Think of this as a coffee break in hell. Sit, sulk, maybe heal a scratch. Fighters and warlocks love it; wizards just whine. Do it too often, and the DM’s monsters get bored and eat you."

  "Shortbow": [
    "1d6 Piercing. Ammunition (80/320), Two-Handed. For when you want to kill something, but you don't want to actually *touch* it. Eww. Germs.",

    "Stab quietly. Great for rogues, light for doubles."
  ],
  "Sickle": [
    "Creepy cutter.",

    "Slice with a garden tool. Low damage, high vibe."
  ],
  "Size": [
    "Bigger targets wear bigger boots. Statistics only.",
    "Size is how much space you take up in the dungeon’s kill zone. Tiny? You’re sneaky but squishy. Huge? You’re a walking target. It affects reach, grappling, and how many arrows you catch. Choose your footprint wisely.",
    "Your Size category—Small, Medium, or ‘Why Are You This Big?’—shapes how you fit in the world. Smaller means better hiding, bigger means better intimidation. The dungeon scales its traps to match."
  ],
  "Skill Empowerment": [
    "5th Level Transmutation, Touch, V/S, Concentration. Double proficiency bonus for one skill for 1 hr. Make your rogue a lockpicking god—concentration’s a pain, payoff’s huge.",
    "Skill god mode.",
    "Supercharge a skill. Concentration limits your spells, but expertise shines."
  ],
  "Skills": [
    "Got a high Stealth skill? You’re a shadow. Got a low Persuasion? You’re convincing nobody but the mirror. Pick your skills wisely, or the System will remind you how useless you are.",
    "Skills are the things you’re supposedly good at, like sneaking, lying, or not dying in a trap. Roll a d20, add the stat mod, maybe proficiency. Fail, and enjoy the consequences, loser."
  ],
  "Skywrite": [
    "2nd Level Transmutation, Sight, V/S, Ritual, Concentration. 10 words in clouds, lasts 1 hr or until dispersed. Sky graffiti—useless in combat, great for flexing or cryptic messages.",

  ],
  "Sling": [
    "Fling stones like a bully. Pathetic damage, cheap as dirt.",
    "Rock flinger.",
    "Simple Ranged. 1d4 bludgeoning, Ammunition (30/120). Rock in a sock. Weak damage, free ammo—don’t expect respect or kills with this kid’s toy."
  ],
  "Smiths Tools": [
    "Fire, metal, and the confidence to hit something until it becomes useful.",
    "Smiths Tools are for turning raw metal into weapons, armor, or a really intimidating paperweight. Fire, hammers, and sweat—sounds romantic until you botch the roll and melt your sword. Forge wisely, or the dungeon will forge you.",
    "With Smiths Tools, you’re a one-person armory, crafting blades or fixing dented helms. High Strength helps, but nothing saves you from the System’s habit of spawning rust monsters. Make it sharp, or make it quick."
  ],
  "Snare": [
    "1st Level Abjuration, Touch, V/S/M. Set 5ft trap, Dex save or restrained until broken (Str check). Magical mousetrap—great for catching goblins or annoying bards.",
    "Budget bear trap.",
    "Rig a snare for fools. Takes time, but traps are fun."
  ],
  "Sneak Attack": [
    "Class Feature. Extra d6s of damage. You fight dirty. You stab them in the kidneys while they're distracted. Requires Finesse/Ranged weapon and Advantage (or an ally nearby).",
    "You don't fight fair, you fight to win. Pile on the damage dice. If you aren't rolling a handful of d6s, you aren't playing a Rogue correctly."
  ],
  "Somatic": [
    "Mandatory mystical gestures.",
    "Somatic components are the fancy hand-waves that make your spells go boom. Need free hands and room to flail—armor might screw you over. Botch the gesture, and the System’s laughing.",
    "Your Somatic spell parts are the dance moves of magic. Precise, deliberate, and useless if you’re tied up or wearing gauntlets. Move those fingers right, or your spell’s just a bad interpretive dance."
  ],
  "Spear": [
    "Pointy stick.",
    "Simple Melee. 1d6 piercing (1d8 Versatile), Thrown (20/60). Poke or throw this pointy stick. Versatile for fancy fighters, range for runners—basic but functional.",
    "Stab or toss, your choice. Solid early weapon, fades late."
  ],
  "Species": [
    "Determines how society judges you before you speak.",
    "Some species get darkvision. Some get stereotypes.",
    "Species is the cosmic lottery that decides if you’ve got claws, wings, or a face only a lich could love. It comes with perks like darkvision or breathing fire, but also baggage like ‘elves are snooty’ or ‘dwarves smell like ale.’ Pick one, and the dungeon will stereotype you faster than you can say ‘racial bonus.’",
    "Your Species is why you’re a furry, a robot, or just a boring human with delusions of grandeur. It tweaks your stats, slaps on some traits, and makes NPCs judge you before you open your mouth. Choose wisely, or you’ll be the token halfling everyone blames for short jokes.",
    "Your biological or mechanical excuse for your stats.",
    "Your biological template, complete with perks, flaws, and cultural baggage you will absolutely validate."
  ],
  "Species Traits": [
    "Includes stance, stride, and balance tendencies.",
    "Species Traits are the freebies your ancestry tosses in, like a tiefling’s fire resistance or a gnome’s cunning. They’re cool until the dungeon counters with a fire-immune ice dragon. Enjoy your perks, crawler.",
    "These are the quirks your Species brings to the table—darkvision, flight, or just being really good at eating dirt. Species Traits give you an edge, but the System’s got an edge-sharpening stone."
  ],
  "Speed": [
    "Measured in strides, not dignity.",
    "Speed is how fast you sprint from danger or toward your next bad decision. Measured in feet per turn, it’s the difference between ‘heroic charge’ and ‘eaten by wolves.’ High Dex helps, heavy armor doesn’t.",
    "Your Speed stat decides if you’re a blur or a sitting duck. Run, dodge, or just trip over your own cape—either way, the dungeon’s faster. Pro tip: Boots don’t help if you’re carrying 50 pounds of loot."
  ],
  "Spell Ability": [
    "The stat you use to bully the universe.",
    "This stat decides how much the universe listens when you cast a spell. Spell Ability powers your magic’s punch and its Save DC. Dump it, and your spells are just fancy light shows.",
    "Your Spell Ability is the stat that fuels your magic—Int for wizards, Wis for clerics, Cha for bards. Higher means stronger spells and tougher saves. Low? Your Fireball’s more like a sparkler."
  ],
  "Spell Slots": [
    "Daily reality edits.",
    "Spell Slots are your magical gas tank. Each spell level eats one, and when you’re out, you’re just a nerd with a stick. Rest to refill, or beg the DM for a nap. Good luck with that.",
    "This is the System’s way of saying, ‘No, you can’t Fireball everything.’ Higher-level slots for bigger booms, but you’ll burn through ‘em faster than a bard’s self-esteem. Choose wisely, or don’t. I don’t care."
  ],
  "Spellcasting": [
    "Reality bending through confidence and hand motions.",
    "Spellcasting is you bending reality with words, gestures, and a lot of ego. Wizards, clerics, and bards do it best, but everyone’s jealous. Run out of Spell Slots, and you’re just yelling at the void.",
    "This is your ticket to rewriting the dungeon’s rules—fireballs, heals, or turning foes into frogs. Spellcasting’s great until the System slaps you with a counterspell or a silence zone. Cast fast, cry later."
  ],
  "Spider Climb": [
    "2nd Level Transmutation, Touch, V/S/M, Concentration. Walk on walls/ceilings for 1 hr. Be a human gecko—perfect for dodging or creeping out allies.",
    "Gecko mode.",
    "Stick to walls like a bug. Concentration’s a pain, mobility’s fun."
  ],
  "Stone Shape": [
    "4th Level Transmutation, Touch, V/S/M. Reshape 5ft cube of stone, no fine detail. Sculpt a door or trap—limited by your lack of artistry, but stone’s forgiving.",
    "Mold stone like clay. No combat use, great for shortcuts.",
    "Rock sculptor."
  ],
  "Stoneskin": [
    "4th Level Abjuration, Touch, V/S/M, Concentration. Resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning/piercing/slashing for 1 hr. Turn skin to stone—pricey but tanky, laugh at swords.",
    "Halve physical damage. Concentration and cost hurt, tank’s dream.",
    "Rock-hard hide."
  ],
  "Strength": [
    "High Strength means broken furniture.",
    "Low Strength means creative solutions.",
    "Oh, you thought Strength was just for swinging swords? It’s also for carrying your team’s emotional baggage when they inevitably cry about their tragic backstory. Pro tip: If it’s heavy, you’re the mule. Deal with it.",
    "Raw force output and door-negotiation skill.",
    "Strength measures how much you can bench press, yeet a goblin, or flex intimidatingly at a tavern brawl. High score? You’re a meat wall. Low score? Hope you enjoy being the party’s designated twig. Roll a d20 and add this to smash stuff or grapple some fool."
  ],
  "Studded Leather": [
    "AC 12 + Dex Modifier. Light Armor. Like Leather Armor, but with little metal bits that make you look edgy. It’s the best light armor you can get without magic. Enjoy the chafing.",
    "The Rogue’s tuxedo. It lets you flip around and hide in shadows while offering just enough protection to keep your insides on the inside."
  ],
  "Stunning Strike": [
    "Monk Feature. You punch them in the soul. Constitution Save or they lose their turn. If this lands on the boss, the DM will cry. If it misses, you wasted a Ki point. Gamble away.",
    "The reason Monks exist. You turn an enemy into a punching bag for a round. Spam this until the DM bans you."
  ],
  "Subclass": [
    "Because you wanted your mistakes to feel bespoke.",
    "Subclass is where your Class gets spicy—think Fighter but with a side of eldritch knight or Rogue with a knack for arcane trickery. It’s the flavor that makes you less generic, but also the reason your DM sighs when you pull out some obscure ability. Own it, you niche weirdo.",
    "This is where flavor becomes mechanical.",
    "This is your Class’s midlife crisis, where it decides to specialize in something like ‘shadow monk’ or ‘beast master.’ Subclass gives you cool tricks but also a reputation—like how everyone assumes warlocks sold their soul. Spoiler: You probably did."
  ],
  "Successes": [
    "Each Success on a Death Save is a middle finger to the grim reaper. You’re bleeding out, but still clinging to life. Rack up three, and you’re stable—unless your party’s too busy looting your corpse to notice.",
    "Moments death reconsidered.",
    "Successes in Death Saves are the System’s reluctant thumbs-up for not dying yet. Roll a 10+ on a d20 at 0 HP, and you’re one step closer to stabilizing. Three of these, and you’re back in the fight. Don’t celebrate yet."
  ],
  "Sword Burst": [
    "AoE slash for crowded fights. Weak damage, scales up, great for slicing through minions.",
    "Cantrip. Conjuration, Self (5ft), V. Dex save or 1d6 force damage to all within 5ft, scales. Spin with invisible blades to clear mooks or just look cool while surrounded.",
    "Whirlwind of sharp force."
  ],
  "Tasha’s Caustic Brew": [
    "1st Level Evocation, 30ft line, V/S/M, Concentration. Dex save or 2d4 acid damage/round until wiped off. Spray acid like a skunk—keep it burning for extra screams.",
    "Acid stream that sticks. Concentration’s a drag, damage adds up.",
    "Lingering chemical burn."
  ],
  "Thieves Tools": [
    "Ah yes, the official kit for touching things you absolutely should not be touching. If it clicks, great. If it snaps, you’re about to meet consequences.",
    "Thieves Tools are your VIP pass to places you’re definitely not invited. Lockpicks, wires, and a prayer you don’t trigger the acid trap. High Dex helps, but nothing saves you from the System’s love of ‘surprise’ explosions. Click carefully.",
    "This kit screams ‘I’m up to no good,’ and the dungeon agrees. Thieves Tools let you bypass locks, disable traps, or accidentally arm the doomsday device. Roll well, or your epitaph will read ‘Almost Got It.’"
  ],
  "Thieves' Tools": [
    "Add Proficiency to checks for traps and locks. The skeleton key for people who don't respect property rights. Essential for bypassing the Dungeon’s fun little murder-puzzles.",
    "If you don't have these, you're opening chests with a hammer, which ruins the loot, Crawler. Don't be a savage. Pick the lock."
  ],
  "Thorn Whip": [
    "Cantrip. Transmutation, 30ft, V/S/M. Melee spell attack, 1d6 piercing, scales, pull Large or smaller target 10ft closer. Lash with a spiky vine—drag enemies into traps or for fun.",
    "Spiky vine leash.",
    "Whip and yank foes closer. Decent damage, scales, great for battlefield control."
  ],
  "Thunderclap": [
    "Cantrip. Evocation, Self (5ft), S. Con save or 1d6 thunder damage to all within 5ft, scales, audible 100ft. Scream loud enough to hurt—great for waking the dungeon’s worst nightmares.",
    "Noisy pain bubble.",
    "Sonic burst for nearby foes. Weak damage, scales, loud as hell. Expect company."
  ],
  "Tinker's Tools": [
    "For when you look at a perfectly functional object and think, ‘I can make this worse, but interesting.’",
    "Tinker's Tools are for mad geniuses who think they can outsmart the dungeon with a wrench and some wire. Build a clockwork bomb, fix a broken trap, or create something the party will regret. Results not guaranteed, but explosions are.",
    "With Tinkers Tools, you’re one bad roll away from a gadget that either saves the day or sets your beard on fire. Craft gizmos, repair gear, or invent a ‘self-destructing backpack.’ The System’s betting on the beard fire."
  ],
  "Tiny Servant": [
    "3rd Level Transmutation. You touch an object and give it little arms and legs. It follows your orders. Finally, a friend who won't argue about loot distribution.",
    "Create a mindless minion to carry your stuff or trigger traps for you. It has 10 HP and no will to live. Treat it as expendable as the rest of your party."
  ],
  "Transmute Rock": [
    "5th Level Transmutation, 120ft, V/S/M. 40ft cube rock to mud or vice versa, restrain or collapse. Turn stone to slop or trap foes in rock—terrain control deluxe.",

    "Rock-mud switch."
  ],
  "Trident": [
    "Martial Melee. 1d6 piercing (1d8 Versatile), Thrown (20/60). Poseidon’s fork. Poke or toss, slightly better than a spear—versatile for showy fighters.",
    "Sea god’s fork.",
    "Stab or throw, bit fancier. Decent, not dazzling."
  ],
  "Unarmed Strike": [
    "1 Damage + Strength Mod. Unless you’re a Monk or have claws, this is just you slapping a monster. Good luck with that. The viewers love a scrappy underdog who dies immediately.",
    "You are punching armor. Why are you punching armor? You have weapons. Use them, you idiot."
  ],
  "Verbal": [
    "Arcane shouting.",
    "This is you yelling arcane gibberish to bend reality. Verbal spell parts need a clear voice and no interruptions. Get silenced, and you’re just a nerd waving your arms. Speak loud, crawler.",
    "Verbal components are the magic words you shout to make spells work. Sounds cool until you’re gagged or in a silence zone. Pro tip: Practice your enunciation, or the dungeon will mishear ‘Fireball’ as ‘Fizzle.’"
  ],
  "Vicious Mockery": [
    "Cantrip. 1d4 Psychic. Wisdom Save. You insult them so hard they suffer actual brain damage. Also gives Disadvantage on their next attack. Sticks and stones break bones, but words hurt more.",
    "The Bard special. You hurt their feelings. If you kill a boss with this, you become a legend. If you fail, you just look petty."
  ],

  "War Pick": [
    "Armor piercer.",
    "Martial Melee. 1d8 piercing. Pointy hammer. Pierces armor, looks brutal—no frills, just a solid choice for cracking tough nuts.",
    "Punch holes in armor. Decent damage, no nonsense."
  ],
  "Warding Bond": [
    "2nd Level Abjuration, Touch, V/S/M. +1 AC/saves, resistance to damage for 1 hr, you take equal damage. Link with a buddy—great until you both eat a fireball.",
    "Pain-sharing pact.",
    "Share pain for buffs. Risky, but tanks love the extra AC."
  ],
  "Warforged": [
    "A living construct: proof that someone once thought free will was optional.",
    "As a Warforged, you’re a walking forge with a soul and a chip on your shoulder. Built for battle, you’re tough but slow to trust. The dungeon loves throwing magnets at you. Stay shiny, tin can.",
    "Warforged are the System’s nod to ‘what if robots had feelings?’ You don’t sleep, eat, or breathe, but you still get to enjoy the dungeon’s emotional meat grinder. Bonus: Your AC’s decent. Downside: Rust.",
    "You do not eat, sleep, or breathe—yet somehow still feel existential dread."
  ],
  "Warhammer": [
    "Crush with a hammer. Versatile, great for divine bruisers.",
    "Holy smasher.",

  ],
  "Water Breathing": [
    "3rd Level Transmutation, 30ft, V/S/M, Ritual. 10 creatures breathe underwater for 24 hr. Gill simulator—great for sunken loot, useless in a desert or fire plane.",
    "Mermaid mode.",
    "Swim without drowning. No concentration, perfect for aquatic heists."
  ],

    "Walk on water like a smug prophet. No concentration, great for swamps."
  ],
  "Weapons": [
    "Tools designed to end conversations.",
    "Weapons are your tools for turning enemies into past-tense problems. Swords, bows, or a stick you found—roll to hit, roll for damage, pray it’s enough. The dungeon’s got bigger sticks, by the way.",
    "Your Weapon’s your best friend until it breaks or you fumble it into a chasm. Melee or ranged, each has a dice type and a dream of glory. Pro tip: Sharpen it before the dragon laughs at you."
  ],
  "Weavers Tools": [
    "For creating cloth, rope, and the illusion that you understand textiles.",
    "This kit’s for crafting fabric-based miracles—sails, nets, or a snazzy cape to distract the goblins. Weavers Tools are niche until you’re dangling from a cliff and realize rope is your best friend. Weave fast, crawler.",
    "Weavers Tools let you spin thread into cloaks, ropes, or a tapestry of your many failures. Useful for disguises, repairs, or just looking fabulous while the dragon roasts you. Low Dex? Enjoy your lumpy scarf."
  ],
  "Web": [
    "2nd Level Conjuration, 60ft, V/S/M, Concentration. 20ft cube, Dex save or restrained, Str check to escape. Sticky trap for mooks—burns nicely, just don’t trap yourself.",

  ],
  "Whip": [
    "Lash from afar. Low damage, high swagger.",

    "Snappy showoff."
  ],
  "Wild Shape": [
    "Druid Feature. You turn into an animal. You gain their HP. When you die as a bear, you pop out as a person, perfectly fine. It’s like an extra life, but furrier.",
    "Solve complex problems by turning into a beast that doesn't understand the problem. Need to scout? Be a spider. Need to kill? Be a wolf. Need to escape? Be a bird and fly away from your responsibilities."
  ],
  "Wisdom": [
    "Awareness, instincts, and hindsight avoidance.",
    "This is not intelligence. Stop arguing.",
    "This stat saves you from your own stupidity—sometimes. It’s also for clerics who think their god cares about their dice rolls. Roll Wisdom to avoid falling for the bard’s ‘totally legit’ pyramid scheme.",
    "Wisdom is your gut telling you not to trust that shady NPC offering ‘free candy.’ High Wisdom? You’re a perceptive sage. Low Wisdom? You’re eating dirt because it ‘looked nutritious.’ Use it for insight or spotting ambushes.",
    "You *felt* the trap. You ignored it."
  ],
  "Wood Carvers Tools": [
    "A slow, patient craft in a world that keeps trying to kill you.",
    "With these tools, you sculpt wood into totems, arrows, or a sign that says ‘Don’t Touch.’ Wood Carvers Tools are great for roleplay until the dungeon decides your masterpiece is kindling. Carve carefully, or cry later.",
    "Wood Carvers Tools are for turning logs into art, holy symbols, or a creepy doll that freaks out the cleric. Precision matters, but so does not carving your thumb off. High Dex helps, low patience doesn’t.",
    "You remove wood until something recognizable remains. Ideally not your fingers."
  ],
  "XP": [
    "Earned through violence, cleverness, or exploitation.",
    "Experience Points are the System’s way of quantifying your trauma. More XP means you’re closer to a power spike, but also to the dungeon noticing you’re a threat. Grind hard, crawler, or I’ll make sure your next ‘encounter’ is a TPK.",
    "Progress points awarded for risk-taking and emotional damage.",
    "This is your progress bar.",
    "XP is the dungeon’s currency of suffering—earn it by killing, scheming, or accidentally solving puzzles. Stack enough, and you Level up, unlocking new ways to disappoint me. Run out of things to slaughter? Too bad, no XP for crying about it."
